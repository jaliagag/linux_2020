When you successfully log into a tty terminal, the program providing that prompt is a shell. Some shells:

- Bash: GNU Bourne Again Shell
- Dash: Debian Almquist Shell. Smaller shell does not alow command-line editing or command history, but it does provide faster shell program execution.
- KornShell: programming shell compatible with Bourne shell but supports advanced programming features, such as those available in the C programming languages
